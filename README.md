# Hi, I'm Burak (aka shayhowler) 👋

Systems and cross‑platform developer who cares about security, privacy, performance, simplicity, and getting things done.  
I ship with Go for speed of execution, build systems/native tools with Rust/Elixir/Gleam, and use Kotlin and Swift for mobile.  
Landing pages are SSR; apps are CSR. No React. No Java. JS only when absolutely necessary.

# 🚢 What I’m building
- Browser project with multi language support to start a new era on web
  - Learning phase
- Database project with Rust, Elixir, Gleam
  - Learning phase

# 🧪 Contributions
- plist package used by Tauri compilation for macOS; previously a small one‑liner PR in the Tauri ecosystem

# 🧭 Opinions (strong but informed)
- Go: unbeatable for shipping fast and keeping things simple
- Rust: systems/native first; safety + performance without bloat
- Elixir/Gleam/Phoenix: leaning into BEAM’s concurrency with a JS‑free direction in mind; tracking LiveView Native
- Kotlin/Swift: great DX for mobile
- React, Java, OOP bloat: hard no
- JavaScript: not a fan — used only when I must (no TypeScript stack)
- Databases: Supabase for practicality; SQLite only when it really makes sense; not into heavyweight DBs
- OS: I hate Windows (Trashdows). I like both Linux and macOS.

# 🌐 Approach
- Landing pages SSR; applications CSR — do the right thing for the job
- Resource‑friendly, small binaries, fast cold starts
- Security and privacy first

# 📚 Projects & Experience

## School Projects
- Whisperer — real‑time chat app (React + Django)
- Java Term Project — CLI app for managing lectures and grades
- GYM4EVERY1 — discontinued, incomplete mobile app
- Authify — password reset/confirmation flow with Supabase (deep‑link workaround for GYM4EVERY1)

## Personal Projects
- Multiple small Rust repos (algorithms, learning Rust by doing)
- Multi‑account email client

## Internships
- Internship 1:
  - Integrated ChatGPT and Perplexity APIs into a .NET API and orchestrated them to “talk” for SEO‑friendly article generation
  - Instagram/Facebook Graph API integration for social account tracking
  - Authored SEO‑optimized articles
- Internship 2:
  - Some Spring Boot
  - Migrated React frontend to Next.js with SEO considerations and image optimization
  - CSR/SSR split where appropriate
  - Custom auth; integrated full‑stack security (frontend + backend)
  - Iyzico sandbox integration (not a fan of it)

# 🧱 Future itch
- Browser project (Rust/Go/Elixir/Gleam
- DB project (Rust/Go/Elixir/Gleam)
- Write my own OS and kernel from scratch someday

# 🎮 Off‑hours
Assassin’s Creed, researching new tech stacks, reading OS/dev internals.
